# Spare Me #

Spare Me is a game about bowling for the [Js13kGames competition][comp].

## Features ##

Spare Me has the following bits of awesomeness:

* play on any device with sweet scaling graphics
* get social bragging rights with tweetable high scores
* never lose your place with automatic save games
* crank up the competiion with dynamic difficulty levels
* start bowling fast with an inline tutorial

## Credits ##

Spare Me was inspired by Sid Sackon's card game, _Bowling Solitaire_. I first
heard about it from [Neil Thomson's review on Board Game Geek][bgg]. THe rules
are simple but the scoring's complex, and I felt that made it an ideal candiate
for Js13kGames. My version pawns off the adjacency rules as difficulty levels
and ditches playing cards for themetic graphics.

### Graphics ###

All the graphics for Spare Me, with the exception of the Twitter Bird, where
created with HTML5 and CSS3. The background wood texture is a color shifted
version of [Randy Merrill's cicada stripes pattern][stripes]. The pins and balls
where based on [Donovan Hutchinson's tutorial on CSS spheres][spheres]. Button
styling comes from [Rishabh's demo for pushable buttons][buttons]. The paper for
score keeping and rules is [Sarah Backhouse's lined papper pattern][paper] and
the sticky tape that holds it up comes from [Sharon's tutorial][tape]. The
pencil is a tiny tilted version of [Bryce Snyder's flat pencil][pencil]. The
text that shows up on strikes and spares is [Mark Dotto's design][text].
Finally, the title is done in the same neon that [Dudley Storey uses for his
bar sign][neon].
