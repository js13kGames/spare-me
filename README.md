# Spare Me #

Spare Me is a game about bowling for the [Js13kGames competition][comp].

## Features ##

Spare Me has the following bits of awesomeness:

* play on any device with sweet scaling graphics
* get social bragging rights with tweetable high scores
* never lose your place with automatic save games
* crank up the competition with dynamic difficulty levels
* start bowling fast with an inline tutorial

## Credits ##

Spare Me was inspired by Sid Sackon's card game, _Bowling Solitaire_. I first
heard about it from [Neil Thomson's review on Board Game Geek][bgg]. The rules
are simple but the scoring is complex, and I felt that made it an ideal candidate
for Js13kGames. My version pawns off the adjacency rules as difficulty levels
and ditches playing cards for thematic graphics.

### Graphics ###

All the graphics for Spare Me, with the exception of the GitHub Octocat and
Twitter Bird, where created with HTML5 and CSS3. The background wood texture
is a color shifted version of [Randy Merrill's cicada stripes pattern][stripes].
The pins and balls where based on [Donovan Hutchinson's tutorial on CSS
spheres][spheres]. Button styling comes from [Rishabh's demo for pushable
buttons][buttons]. The paper for score keeping and rules is [Sarah Backhouse's
lined paper pattern][paper] and the sticky tape that holds it up comes from
[Sharon's tutorial][tape]. The pencil is a tiny tilted version of [Bryce
Snyder's flat pencil][pencil]. The text that shows up on strikes and spares is
[Mark Dotto's design][text].  Finally, the title is done in the same neon that
[Dudley Storey uses for his bar sign][neon].
